# CogniAPI
Vision and Language APIs which allow to get more clear information about an image or a text, using and/or combining pre-existing and well established ML Services (like Microsoft Computer Vision, Google Cloud, Vision, Amazon Rekognition). The current repository contains also an example of how to use them, displaying the results through a web-based widget.
